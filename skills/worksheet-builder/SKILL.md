name: worksheet-builder
description: Build the tabbed HTML copy-paste worksheet that helps Yuriy fill out a DataMaster / ACI report from gathered order data. Use whenever Yuriy says "build the worksheet", "make the DM worksheet", "/build-worksheet", "copy-paste worksheet", "worksheet for <address>", "assemble the record and render it", or wants the Subject / Comp-grid / Sale-history / Photos / Map worksheet for an order. Renders `appraisal-record.json` → `worksheet.html` via tools/worksheet-renderer, AFTER passing the comp-quality completeness gate (so previously-seen comp-data gaps never ship again). The appraiser reviews, adjusts, and certifies — this assembles + renders, never submits.

# Worksheet Builder

> **Runtime: COWORK (Bob).** This is the interactive path — Bob gathers data, asks Yuriy
> for approvals (e.g. Photos/Map), hand-assembles the record when the assembler isn't available,
> and renders. The **automated** equivalent for **Claude Code** is the `/build-worksheet` command
> (`.claude/commands/build-worksheet.md`). Same deliverable + same completeness gate; two front doors.

> **Triage / prep scope follows `vault/20-standard-work/SOP-triage.md`** — prep ALL in-scope WIP
> (View A, assignee-blind; Alan's orders included, never skipped at prep). One rule, both lanes.

Produces the **tabbed HTML copy-paste worksheet** that Yuriy pastes into
DataMaster / ACI. **Default tabs: Subject · Comp grid · Sale/Listing history.**
**Photos and Map are OPTIONAL — include them only with Yuriy's explicit approval**
(ask before adding; omit by default). Bob ASSEMBLES the data and RENDERS it; the
licensed appraiser judges adjustments and certifies. **Never submit.**

Inputs → output: `appraisal-record.json` (per `appraisal-record.schema.json`)
→ `worksheet.html` via `tools/worksheet-renderer/render_worksheet.py`.

## Subject data pull checklist (pull ALL fields in one pass — not iteratively)

Learned from 3355 Darbytown Rd: pulling a subset and then adding fields on request wastes
rounds. Run this checklist in full before declaring subject data complete.

### Source 1 — County assessment portal (SOR)
Pull in a single session; record every field even if blank (blank is data):
- **Identification:** GPIN, PID, Subdivision, Section/Block/Lot, Zoning
- **Legal description:** from parcel detail (needed for DM Subject tab)
- **Lot:** Acreage *(often blank in Henrico APEX → go to Zillow immediately; don't leave blank)*
- **Improvements:** Style, # Stories, Year Built, Total Rooms, Bedrooms, Full Baths, Half Baths
- **Above-grade GLA** (county SOR governs — note if it conflicts with MLS)
- **Exterior:** Ext Walls code, Roof type
- **Foundation:** Foundation Type *(note: type only — material requires inspection)*
- **Mechanical:** Heating code, AC code, Fireplace count
- **Sketch codes:** read every code — WDK=deck, PCO/PCU=covered porch, OP=open porch,
  GR1/GR2=garage, WS=workshop; record sf for each

### Source 2 — Zillow (supplement + cross-check)
Pull immediately after APEX — don't wait to be asked:
- **Lot size** — always check; fill in when APEX acreage is blank
- **Legal description** — often in listing details if APEX parcel page doesn't show it
- **Photos** — scan the listing photo set for:
  - Floor material (living/dining shots → hardwood, carpet, tile, LVP)
  - Fireplace presence + surround style (living room photo)
  - Front porch type (exterior shot #1: stoop only vs. covered porch)
  - Rear deck/patio (rear exterior shot)
  - Garage (exterior or interior shots)
  *(Flag all photo-derived items as "Zillow — confirm at inspection")*

### What is NEVER in APEX — always flag for inspection
- Foundation wall material (APEX records type only, e.g. Crawl, Basement)
- Interior finishes (floors in rooms not visible in photos, bath tile, countertops)
- Cooling type (sometimes present as AC code; if blank, confirm at inspection)
- Condition / effective age (appraiser judgment)

### Output before moving to comps
Present the full subject profile in DM 1004 field order (Subject → Site → Improvements →
Foundation → Exterior → Interior → HVAC → Amenities → Garage) with every field either
populated or explicitly flagged `⚠️ confirm at inspection` or `⚠️ not in APEX`. No silent blanks.

## Workflow
1. **Gather / locate the record.** If an `appraisal-record.json` exists for the order, use it.
   Otherwise run the **Subject data pull checklist above** (APEX → Zillow in one pass), then
   gather comps via `skills/property-search`, and assemble the record.
2. **Apply data-quirks normalizations** from `skills/property-search/references/data-quirks.md`
   (e.g. MLS `BRTVA→VA`, Chesterfield TaxID rounding). Don't render un-normalized values.
3. **Run the COMPLETENESS GATE below — do not render until it passes.**
4. **Render:** `python tools/worksheet-renderer/render_worksheet.py <record.json> -o <order>/worksheet.html`.
   Default tabs = Subject · Comp grid · Sale/Listing history. **Photos and Map are OFF by default**
   — add `--with-photos` / `--with-map` ONLY after Yuriy explicitly approves including them.
5. **Self-check the output** (tabs populated, flags surfaced, review gate shows NOT CERTIFIED),
   then hand the worksheet to the appraiser to review / adjust / certify.

## ✅ Completeness gate (hard-won comp-quality lessons — never ship these missing)
Block rendering and fix/flag first if any fails:
- **Comp count:** ≥ **3 CLOSED** comps (regulatory minimum); target **3–5**. Present the best
  closed sales, not the whole GLA band.
- **Segregate status:** CLOSED sales are the comps; **Active/Pending are listing analysis only** —
  never let an Active masquerade as a sold comp.
- **County-tag every comp.** Comps in a neighboring VA county are OK but MUST be (a) labeled with
  their county and (b) **verified against THAT county's SOR** (out-of-county comps often arrive with
  missing/unverified GLA — see data-quirks XCO-001).
- **Never emit unverified GLA.** If above-grade GLA is missing/unconfirmed (common on out-of-county
  MLS rows), set it null and add a `flags` entry — do NOT guess or leave it silently blank.
- **Flag superiority/inferiority:** water-view / waterfront / location-superior comps are NOT directly
  comparable to a non-view subject — flag and set aside (don't bury them in the grid).
- **Form-specific required fields:** check the `references/field-map/field-map.<form>.yaml` for the
  order's form and confirm its required fields are present (e.g. **1073 Project Information** — unit
  counts, roof, parking; **1004C** — HUD data plate / manufacturer). Missing → flag, don't omit silently.
- **Per-comp data complete:** each comp carries prior **3-yr sale** history (1004 requirement),
  **DOM / contract date**, and the **above/below-grade GLA split** — flag (never silently blank) if missing.
- **GLA-band sanity:** luxury/large subjects (GLA > 5,000 sf) use the **±15%** band (per `property-search`);
  cross-check a radius pull so the band didn't drop an obviously-superior **same-subdivision** comp.
- **Review gate:** record's `review.human_reviewed=false` and `adjustments` left to the appraiser.

## Rules
- Assemble + render only; **never submit or certify** (USPAP — appraiser is the gate).
- Deterministic renderer (stdlib, no network) — same record → same worksheet.
- Outputs go to the order folder under `VDV Appraisals\`, **never the repo** (client data).
- New data-source gotcha encountered while building → add it to `data-quirks.md` proactively.

## Condition profiles (default Improvements values by tier)
To fill the Improvements section + comp Quality/Condition fast, pull defaults from
`references/condition-profiles/condition-profiles.<form>.yaml` (forms: 1004, 2055,
gpar, 1073) for the matching tier — **new · average · fair**. UAD forms use Q/C codes
+ `material/rating` (e.g. `Q3`, `C3`, `Drywall/Avg`); gPAR uses words (Good/Average/Fair).
**Average + new are grounded in past VDV reports; fair (and all of 1073) are
extrapolated** (`observed_in_corpus: false`) — paste as a scaffold, then EDIT to the
real property and itemize C5 deficiencies. The profile saves typing, not judgment.
See `references/condition-profiles/_model.md`.

**Pick a tier → pre-fill the worksheet** (automated): generates the worksheet with the
tier's Improvements + Q/C defaults already in place (amber = default, verify & edit):
```powershell
python tools/dm-collection-sheet/prefill_worksheet.py --form 1004 --tier average `
    --out "C:\Users\yuriy\VDV Appraisals\<order>\<addr>_worksheet.html"
```
Order-specific tokens ({{ADDRESS}}, IDs) stay blank for you to fill. The banner flags
whether the tier is grounded or extrapolated.
